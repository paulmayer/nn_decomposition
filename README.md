Decomposing Neural Networks
===========================

This repository experiments with neural network decompositions explaining generalisation features as described by [Olson, Wyner and Berk: Modern Neural Networks Generalize on Small Data Sets (NIPS, 2018)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7620-modern-neural-networks-generalize-on-small-data-sets.pdf)
